 *  @brief This method handles the whole process of dealing with the universal links.
 *  @discussion From requesting the redirected link to handle the process of getting all the files inside the folder
 *  and managing the possible errors if they existed.
 *
 *  It asks for the redirection of the private link and get a sorted sequence of FileDTO from the Root forlder to the
 *  file or folder desired (Which is represented by the private link).
 *
 *  For example if you have the private link url like @a https://server.com/f/12
 *  After you ask for the redirection of this link you now have @a https://server.com/remote.php/webdav/Documents/Photos
 *  So the items to return would look like:
 *
 *  @code
 *  +---------+-----------+---------+
 *  | FileDTO |  FileDTO  | FileDTO |
 *  +---------+-----------+---------+
 *  | Root    | Documents | Photos  |
 *  +---------+-----------+---------+
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @param success A sorted sequence of FileDTO from Root to the folder or file tapped in the link.
 *  @param failure Error in the workflow.
